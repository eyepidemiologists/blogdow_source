<h2>Job Description:</h2>
<p>The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher willing to work on the modeling of the climate-mortality relation within the H2020 project PUCS (find a description of the project below). The research will be carried out in parallel with the work done for the H2020 projects ACCLIM and Blue-Action, both also on temperature-related mortality, and will be supervised by Dr. Joan Ballester from the Climate and Health Program: <a href="www.joanballester.eu" class="uri">www.joanballester.eu</a><br />
Ideal candidates should have all of the following attributes below: 1. PhD in mathematics, statistics, epidemiology, climate sciences or related field. 2. Demonstrated experience in building, calibrating and validating mathematical, statistical and/or epidemiological models, preferably in the area of climate impacts on human health. 3. Basic knowledge of climate sciences, and interest in climate impacts and services. 4. Demonstrated high capacity in common programming languages, and particularly in R. 5. Previous experience with climate data and tools. 6. Demonstrated successful capacity to write manuscripts and proposals. 7. Fluency in spoken and written English. 8. Previous experience and willingness to work in a multidisciplinary and collaborative environment, preferably within the areas of climate variability, predictability, modeling, impacts and services.<br />
The contract is offered for a two-year period, but depending on the candidate’s proven capacity, skills, previous expertise and top-notch publications track record, the position might be extended. The salary will be competitive and commensurate with experience. The job offer will be closed as soon as a suitable candidate is selected, and the position will preferably start anytime after June 1st 2017. To apply please send your full CV, together with a paragraph of interest (maximum 50 words) and a sentence briefly describing your experience/capacity for each of the 8 above-mentioned desired skills (maximum 25 words each).<br />
PUCS (Pan-European Urban Climate Service) is a H2020 innovation project that will take the best available urban climate data and convert it into information that is relevant for public and private end-users operating in cities for a range of different sectors. This will improve decision-making in regard to sector policies and urban planning, and will help end-users to better address the consequences of climate change at the local scale. ISGlobal will closely collaborate with end-users to generate a prototype of forecast scheme of temperature-related mortality for European cities based on climate data and tools developed in the project. The final aim is to demonstrate, replicate, and further upscale a modular and sustainable pan-European urban climate service to propose relevant solutions to end-users. The research aim of ISGlobal’s Climate and Health Program is to address the effects that environmental conditions and climate change have on human health. The research record of scientists in the Program include several high-quality articles in high-impact journals such as Nature, Science, The Lancet, PNAS, Nature Climate Change and Nature Communications. The lines of research include extreme temperatures and precipitation, heat waves and cold spells, the impact of climate change on the spread of infectious (e.g. malaria, dengue, leishmaniosis, chikungunya, Zika) and non-infectious (Kawasaki Syndrome) diseases, the El Ni</p>
